      <p class="margin">Commercial support for both existing Nebulae customers and new OpenSMUS users is available for purchase from the <a href="http://xtras.tabuleiro.com">xtras.tabuleiro.com</a> website, as well as custom server side scripting and additions. Please contact mauricio at tabuleiro.com for inquiries.</p>
    <p class="margin">As the community around the open source edition develops, the OpenSMUS will be updated with additional resources for technical support. At this time two forums are already provided at <a href="http://opensmus.sf.net">opensmus.sf.net</a> for discussion and peer support.</p></td>
