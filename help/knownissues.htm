    <td valign="top" align="left"><p>It is important to understand that not all platforms and Java virtual machines (VM) are created equal. Some VM can support a larger number of concurrent user connections, while others are limited by the underlying operations system. Some platforms handle multiple threads faster, and scale better. The OpenSMUS server does not necessarily impose any limit on the number of simultaneous user connections or messages dispatched by seconds, but its abilities may be limited by the host VM and platform. It is up to the developer to test if a certain server configuration can scale to meet the requirements of a given application. </p>
